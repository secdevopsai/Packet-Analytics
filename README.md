# Packet-Analytics

> Have you ever opened Wireshark and thought, "this is nice, but sometimes filtering and following TCP streams is tedious?" If not, open Wireshark more. In this post, I'll cover how to leverage Python, Scapy, Pandas, and Seaborn to science the shit out of some PCAP. Also, this post will serve as a prequel for our next series on Packet Manipulation with Data Science.
